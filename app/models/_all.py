"""Import all SQLAlchemy model modules for metadata registration.

Alembic autogeneration relies on `Base.metadata` to contain *every* table. In this
codebase, not all model modules are imported from `app.models.__init__`, so Alembic
must import them explicitly.

This module should only be imported by tooling (e.g. Alembic) or test code. Importing
it in request paths is discouraged to avoid eager loading side effects.
